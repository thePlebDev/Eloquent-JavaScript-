- the filter methods creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the
provided function

REDUCE METHOD
- reduce method executes a reducer function(that you provide) on each element of the array resulting in a
single output value

- the reducer function takes four arguments

const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue
randomArray.reduce(reducer)

- the reducers function's returned value is assigned to the accumulator, whose value is remembered
across each iteration throughout the array and finally becomes the final single resulting value.

- the currentValue is the current value of the array
- then you can also provide it with an index and an array value


CONCAT METHOD
- the concat method is used to return two or more arrays. this method does not change the existing arrays
but instead returns a new array

- so it is to my understanding that the reduce method with be given a function and will execute that function
on each element of the array. resulting in a single output value. The function that we will be passing the
function will have two arguments. the first being the accumulator. which is the return value and will be
remembered across each iteration. so for us we will use that function to concat the current value with the
accumulator and then it should return one flattened out array.
- I think my problem is that my reducer function doesn't return anything. I forgot to call return.

HIGH ORDER FUNCTION
- abstraction is a way to hide details and give the ability to talk about problems at a higher level.
- a higher order function is a function that operates on other functions, either by taking them as
arguments or by returning them

THE EVERY METHOD
- returns true when the given function returns true for ever elemene in the array
- so basically it is given a test function and if every element in the array passes passes the test funciton
then the every method will return true.
- so I have my true method working for my function
- so the false value is working but I need to figure out what the return value is doing.
- what does return actually do. The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be
returned to the function caller. when a function encounters a return statement, it always exits its function
immediately, with no further execution if it's inside a loop.
